# Multiplication-perturbation-and-Crypto-index-for-range-query.

The idea of data perturbation is to change the original values of a dataset that is prepared for outsourced data mining, so that the untrusted cloud provider cannot figure out any original value while working on the perturbed data. The basic principle is to preserve both data privacy and data utility - the data owner can still obtain high quality data mining models with the perturbed data. In this experiment, we will be looking at one convenient method - geometric data perturbation (GDP). GDP is designed to preserve the utility for Euclidean-distance based data mining models such as kNN classifiers, linear classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers (with certain kernels), and clustering with Euclidean distance as the similarity measure

Database management is resource consuming. An appealing solution is to export database services to the cloud, which raises privacy concerns, too. Among the existing approaches, crypto-index is a simple solution (not so secure) that transforms a domain to a set of random IDs. It is easy to process queries on transformed data. However, the result may have low precision. In this task, you will implement a simple crypto-index method and experiment wtih single-dimensional range query on transformed data.
